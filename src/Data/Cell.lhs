> -- In this structure, each /cell/ of data is annotated
> -- with information about its relation to the following
> -- cell in the stream, namely /end of cell/, /end of row/
> -- and /end of table/ conditions. In addition, in order
> -- to achieve truly-constant memory usage irrespective of
> -- individual cell size, we allow individual cells to be
> -- subdivided further into /parts/, as indicated by the
> -- /end of part/ condition. Logically, this subdivision
> -- into parts is supposed to be purely operational and
> -- have no semantic significance, similarly to subdivision
> -- of lazy bytestrings into chunks.
