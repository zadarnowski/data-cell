Generic cellular data representation library
============================================

This library defines a simple type used for efficient streaming
of tabular data using coinductive control structures such as
pipes, conduit or iteratees.

It was originally a part of `pipes-cellular-csv`, but was distilled
into a separate module to facilitate interaction between
different tabular data formats and control structures.
